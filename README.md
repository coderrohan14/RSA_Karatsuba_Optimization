This project contains the RSAModel.scala, RSAModelTester.scala, RSATester.scala, and RSA.scala files as of now. The RSAModel is working perfectly for bit size as large as 2048 bits with RSAModelTester passing all the test cases. We are in the process of builiding the Chisel Components for the same. We have a initial chisel module in the RSA.scala file which seems to be fine but has some errors due to which the test cases in the RSATester.scala were failing. For now, I have commented the part in the RSATester so that you can test the project using sbt test. We are planning to have separate chisel modules for Karatsuba Multiplication, Modular Exponentiation, and Modular Inverse functions, so that they can be integrated in the RSA module directly.
